# inventory

Minimal inventory management system to track physical assets in a digital database. The assets are identified by QR code labels, which are generated and recognized by inventory. When creating a new item inventory tries to interface automatically with a Niimbot printer to print the corresponding QR label sticker. The QR label is read using a webcam interface.

# Configuration

Settings of different elements of the front and backend are configurable via their respective config file. The following gives a brief overview where to find these files and which parameters to adjust.

## Configure Database

Configure the Database server via the backend/database_config.py file. Make
sure the IP address of the database server is configured correctly.

## Configure Camera Server

Configure the UI server via the backend/camera_config.py file. Default is to
run the camera server on localhost. This requires to run the UI server and
camera server on the same machine, but can be configured otherwise.

## Configure Printer Interface

Configure the printer interface via the backend/printer_config.py file. Make sure
the printers Mac address is configured correctly. Default settings can be
kept when using the Niimbot D110, which is the only tested printer so far.

Note: The printer needs to be on, bluetooth enabled on the machine that runs
the UI server. The printer will not connect permanently, but only
for the short period the print command is sent.

## Configure User Interface

Configure the UI server via the frontend/frontend_config.py file. Make sure
the IP and port of the server are configured correctly, as well as IP and
port of the camera server for the embedded html content.

# Run with Docker

## Run the Database Server with Docker

Required dependencies to run the database

```
sudo apt install libmariadb3 libmariadb-dev
```

This project uses docker to run the database that is holding the inventory.
To compose and run docker needs to be installed.

Start the database container as follows

```
cd inventory/database

docker compose up -d inventory

```

## Run the UI Server with Docker

:construction: Work in Progress :construction:

Build the main application docker container with the following command:

```
cd inventory/

sudo docker build --tag "inventory" .

```

Run the container with:

```

sudo docker run --detach 'inventory'

```

Run the following for debbuging, to keep attached to the running container:

```

sudo docker run 'inventory'

```

## Useful Docker Commands

To check the container status, run:

```

docker ps -a

```

Which should show the influxDb container up and running:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS                       PORTS                                       NAMES
a9066efdb6e7   mariadb:2.1   "/entrypoint.sh inflâ€¦"   25 hours ago   Up About an hour (healthy)   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, :::8086->8086/tcp   inventory

```

# Install and Run Modules Manually

## Install required packages

Required packages

```
sudo apt-get install zbar-tools libmariadb3 libmariadb-dev
```

## Run the Database Server with Docker

The database server currently needs to be run with Docker. See the Docker install & run section on how to run the database server.

## Setup virtual python environment

Set up the virtual python environment and install all required dependencies
as follows:

```

# Go to the inventory root directory
cd inventory

# Create a folder called env
mkdir env

# Create a virtual enviroment
python -m venv env

# Install all required python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Run Application Manually

This is assuming the previous setup has been completed and the database
container is up and running.

Start the application with:

```
python app.py
```

This command includes starting up and handling the following elements:

- the database client
- the camera server
- the UI server

Note that running the application requires having the database server already running.

# Handy Commands

## UV commands

Compile platform independent requirements file from pip requirements.txt
file with uv:

```
uv pip compile requirements.txt --universal --output-file requirements.txt
```

## User Management

Adding, removing or modifying users is currently only possible in the terminal
using helper functions. Make sure the database container is running, when
running the following commands.

Use the following commands to add, delete users, or list all existing database
users. To modify user permissions it is currently required to first delete
the user entirely and then create it again with the altered permissions.

```
python util.create_user.py # Alternatively with uv $ uv run util.create_user.py
```

```
python util.delete_user.py # Alternatively with uv $ uv run util.delete_user.py
```

```
python util.show_users.py # Alternatively with uv $ uv run util.show_users.py
```

# Troubleshooting

The MariaDB docker container will use port 3306 which might conflict with
running mysql services on the target machine, leading to the following error
when starting up the container:

```
Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint inventory (307f628849c076718517dcaf96313d1df854eca239ef314272932975cd6f2396): Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use
```

In that case list services that use this port and shut them down

List services that use port 3306:

```
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep 3306
```

Shut down mysql service on the target machine.

```
sudo service mysql stop
```

To prevent this issue from coming back when the host machine is restarded,
disable the mysql service with:

```
sudo systemctl disable mysql

```

# Hardware Requirements

Inventory is intended to run on any operating system and with any webcam connected to the system that hosts the front-end server. It is developped and tested with a mini PC but could also be hosted on a raspberry Pi in a minimal configuration.
The current label printer interface only works with Niimbot printers (tested only with D110). Inventory was developped and tested with the following hardware:

- BMAX mini PC (to run UI server and database) running Ubuntu 24.04.1
- Logitec C270 webcam (item imaging and QR code detection)
- Niimbot D110 label printer (to print item QR code labels)

## Label Printer setup

To set up a new printer, the printer MAC address needs to be updated in
backend/printer_config.py

```
# Mac address of the Niimbot D110 printer used to print inventory labels
niimbot_d110_inventory_mac_address = '04:08:04:01:31:04'

```
